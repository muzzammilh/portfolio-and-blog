Greetings! I'm Muzzammil Hussain and I'm a full stack developer, solutions architect, and consultant. 
I live in Lahore, Pakistan with my wife and two adorable children.

Over the past 12 years, I have worked with a number of North American startups and companies in the Education, Transportation, E-commerce, and Fintech sectors. 
In addition to helping them improve, scale, and make course corrections, I was involved in the decision-making process. At present, I am a Technical Lead for a company named ["Arbisoft Pvt Ltd"](https://arbisoft.com).

I have experience designing and developing what I refer to as "technically sophisticated" web applications, with a working knowledge of **Python/PHP/Javascript** language standards and application life cycle management. 
Depending on the business requirement, I have developed monolithic and microservice architectures. 
I believe in reaching the market fast, even if your technology is not mature, and continuing to improve what is built based on market insights and user feedback.

My pride comes from the fact that I am good at what I do, i.e
<!-- * Full-stack Development
* Product Development 
* Process Improvements 
* Relationship Management 
* Solution Architecture 
* Change Lifecycles 
* Mentoring
* Leadership -->
